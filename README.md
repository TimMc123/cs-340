-	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  
    I am a python native as most people who learn coding are, we start on python and branch out from there. I still like coding in python but something that I do to make the code maintainable and readable is use each file for a class, so it never gets too congested. I got this idea from coding in java, we have classes in files that we then call in a main file that separate from the others. Like in our project, our CRUD file is separate, this allows us to know exactly where to look at keeps the code clean and maintainable. It also keeps a whole code from breaking when fixing or moving things around.
 	
-	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  
    When I approach a problem as a computer scientist I do the following:
    -	Identify and understand the requirements.
    -	Identify and break down the problems and solutions from hardest to easiest.
    -	Make a plan on how to approach the problem.
    -	Check documentation to see if there is a solution already available.
    -	Talk with the team and to make sure everyoneâ€™s on the same page (This would be the next step if I were part of a team)
    
  -	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    
    I think computer scientists are especially important to the IT world. Computer scientists can create programs that can automate the mondain task that takes up time. They also can help develop technology that can surpass human abilities in calculating complex problems and this leads to alleviating human errors that can arise. In the end computer scientists build programs/software that can help people and/or businesses complete their jobs.
